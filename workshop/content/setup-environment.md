This workshop environment provides you with a Kubernetes cluster to use when running the exercises covered by this workshop. To verify you can access the Kubernetes cluster, run `kubectl version` in the terminal by clicking on the action block below.

```execute
kubectl version

The workshop uses these action blocks for various purposes. Anytime you see such a block with an icon on the right hand side, you can click on it and it will perform the listed action for you.
