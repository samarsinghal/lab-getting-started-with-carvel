The previous section showed how to use `kbld` to build the container image. It failed to deploy in the end as the Kubernetes cluster being used didn't have access to images held by the docker daemon where the build was being run.

In order to have it work for the Kubernetes cluster used by this workshop environment, we will need to push the image to an image registry the cluster can access.

The configuration we will use this time is `config-step-4-build-and-push/push.yml`. To view the file run:

```execute
cat config-step-4-build-and-push/push.yml
```

The output should be:

```
#@ load("@ytt:data", "data")
#@ load("@ytt:assert", "assert")

#@ if/end data.values.push_images:
---
apiVersion: kbld.k14s.io/v1alpha1
kind: ImageDestinations
destinations:
- image: quay.io/eduk8s-labs/sample-app-go
  #@ if not data.values.push_images_repo or len(data.values.push_images_repo) == 0:
  #@   assert.fail("Expected push_images_repo to be non-empty. Example: quay.io/eduk8s-labs/sample-app-go")
  #@ end
  newImage: #@ data.values.push_images_repo
```

The configuration specifies that `quay.io/eduk8s-labs/sample-app-go` should be pushed to an image repository with name as specified by `push_images_repo` data value.


Login to the registry you would like to use

```execute
docker login
```

Now our local docker client is authenticated to the registry we will be pushing to, but otherwise you would need to make sure that it can push to it.

Set registry environment variable 

```
export registry=
```

Also, to prepare for the deployment, we need to create an image pull secret to use with the deployment, so that Kubernetes can pull images from the private repo we are using:

```execute
kubectl create secret generic registry-credentials --from-file=.dockerconfigjson=$HOME/.docker/config.json --type=kubernetes.io/dockerconfigjson
```

Run the combined command to process the template, build the image and deploy it, setting the value for `push_images_repo` in the process.

```execute-1
ytt template -f config-step-4-build-and-push/ -v hello_msg="carvel user" -v push_images=true -v push_images_repo=$registry/sample-app-go | kbld -f- | kapp deploy -a simple-app -f- --diff-changes --yes
```

The key parts of the output which are of interest are:

This time the build and deployment should be successful.

If we inspect again the application we see the new image being referenced:

```execute-1
kapp inspect -a simple-app --raw --filter-kind Deployment --tty=false | kbld inspect -f-

The output should be similar to:

You will note how the image name has been rewritten to reference the image from the image registry it was pushed to, rather than the original location for the image. Also you will see that the image digest reference (e.g. {{ registry_host }}/carvel/sample-app-go@sha256:4c8b96...) was used instead of a tagged reference (e.g. kbld:docker-io...).

Digest references are preferred to other image reference forms as they are immutable, hence provide a guarantee that the exact version of built software will be deployed.
